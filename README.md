# Unlimited Games But No Games Project

## Overview
Unlimited Games but No Games is a small project aimed at recreating classic games using C++, Qt and the raylib library, an open-source library to create graphical applications and games. A game launcher will be developed to manage and run the games from a single interface, and Qt will be integrated for creating a more advanced, user-friendly graphical interface. This project provides an opportunity to enhance programming skills while exploring game development and UI design. Currently, the project includes functional versions of Snake and Tetris, with plans to expand the library of games in the future.
